### 5. **Virtual Reality (VR) Relaxation Experiences**

* AI-driven VR experiences can transport you to peaceful virtual environments, promoting relaxation and stress reduction.

### 6. **Sleep and Relaxation Aids**

* AI-powered sleep monitors and relaxation devices can create customized bedtime routines to improve sleep quality, an essential aspect of resilience.

### 7. **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) Apps**
